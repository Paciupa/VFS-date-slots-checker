# VFS-date-slots-checker
A script that runs in the browser to check whether there are any free slots available with a notification to Telegram. Works for Polish VC in Belarus

1. Open script.js in this repo
2. Copy it somewhere and modify the variables accordingly (follow the comments with hints)
3. Open VFS portal, log in and proceed to the page with VC selectors
4. Open the browser console and run modified script there
5. Close the browser console, the script will stop automatically once the notification is sent
6. Wait until the notification is sent to Telegram

In order to stop the script - reload the page entirely

Please note that VFS currently bans by IP in some short period and auth token lives for 30 minutes only. So you still need to be near your laptop to be able to restart VPN and re-login
